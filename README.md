## About me
After finishing the highly intensive 12-week boot camp, I was aware of how much I could truly achieve in such a small amount of time, I had the opportunity to develop many projects such as 'Chitter' a Twitter clone, a 'tech for good' app called 'Foodshare' and many more. Aside from projects I was also introduced to agile practices and which I was able to use alongside my peers in group projects.

## Current Projects
- I am currently making a Twitter clone but this time using a MERN stack, since I made my first clone in the very first few weeks of the Makers course I plan to implement new knowledge and new features.
- Currently working through Codewars to improve my coding skills.
